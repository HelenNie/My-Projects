My-Projects
===========

Hello!

My name is Helen Nie. I am a junior at MIT studying mechanical engineering and product design. I have been programming since high school and have used programming as a tool in a variety of projects.

1. I learned to program in high school, and my projects from high school CS classes are in the OldHighSchoolProjects folder. 
2. At MIT, I got involved with computer science education and block-based programming languages, namely App Inventor and Gameblox. None of that code is here of course.
3. I am currently taking a product design class that involves web design. My projects for this class are in the webDesign folder.
4. The Linguistics folder contains a simple flask app that I made for my phonetics research project.
