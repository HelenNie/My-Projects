My-Projects
===========

Hello!

My name is Helen Nie. Here lives various programming projects of mine between high school and now.

1. I started programming in high school, and my projects from then are in the OldHighSchoolProjects folder. 
2. I took a product design class in college that involved web design. My projects for this class are in the webDesign folder.
3. The Linguistics folder contains a simple flask app that I made for my phonetics research project during college.
