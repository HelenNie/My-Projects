My-Projects
===========

Hello!

My name is Helen Nie. Here lives various programming projects of mine between high school and now.

1. I learned to program in high school, and my projects from high school CS classes are in the OldHighSchoolProjects folder. 
2. I took a product design class that involves web design. My projects for this class are in the webDesign folder.
3. The Linguistics folder contains a simple flask app that I made for my phonetics research project.
