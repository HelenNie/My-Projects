Chinese Sentences Display
==============

I am involved in a phonetics study about question intonation in Mandarin Chinese. I threw together a simple flask app that we can use in the recording booth to display sentences in a randomized order.

The app has the following functionalities
1. The home page displays the sentences. The participant can go to the next sentences with the 'A' key.
2. The '/records' page displays a record of all the random orders that have been used.
3. The '/email' link emails the up-to-date log, for the moment, to me.
