          <p>Programmers are notoriously known for having too many applications open on their computer. A text editor, Google Chrome, the terminal--that's just the beginning. Don't forget API reference pages, email, Facebook, etc. Some have the luxury of working at triple-screen desktop stations, but some--myself included--are usually running around all day and work on 13-inch Macs. For the latter, the micromanagement of applications and tabs is a stress-inducing and time-consuming process. </p>

          <p>Of course, programmers are not the only group plagued by this problem, but this is a good place to start.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="row">
        <p>The benefit of laptops is that they are relatively light and portable. The downside is that they have limited screen space. Adding an extra monitor isn't an option if you're going for light and portable. Nonetheless, it's hard to argue against the benefits of an extra monitor. Research shows that, "whether you measure your productivity in facts researched, alien spaceships vaporized, or articles written, adding an extra monitor will give your output a considerable boost — 20 percent to 30 percent, according to a survey by Jon Peddie Research" ("<a class="value" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/20/technology/20basics.html?ei=5090&en=6fc17b9bf54ea2ef&ex=1303185600&adxnnl=1&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&adxnnlx=1145537733-/Kdyvqpu0/eVBVNBYUcsqg">The Virtues of a Second Screen</a>", <em>New York Times</em>).</p>

        <p>Perhaps there is a middle ground between portability and screen space. After observing and interviewing a full-time programmer who deals with this problem by carrying around multiple laptops, I decided to redesign the experience. The result is what I call iFly, a name that comes with the promise of an explanation.</p>

          <h5>[Chapter 1] A Brief Bio</h5>
          <p>Paul is a full-time programmer. He is the head of Gameblox, a block-based game programming platform, at the MIT Media Lab. </p>
          <img class="u-max-full-width" src="images/paul.png">
          <h5>[Chapter 2] A Brief Story</h5>
          <p>I observed Paul for ~15 minutes as he worked on the Gameblox codebase.</p>
          <p>Paul had 2 MacBooks in front of him, one for tracking down a bug in Gameblox, and one for testing the new mobile interface. Let's call them laptop1 and laptop2, respectively. He said that doing both tasks on the same laptop would require jumping between too many applications and tabs, as well as cause slowness. Laptop1 had ~30 tabs open in Chrome and ~30 icons on the dock, while laptop2 had around half as many for each but is twice as slow, due to having to compile the mobile code. In order, these are the things that Paul did.

      <h5>Additional Features</h5>
      <div class="row">
        There are a lot of possibilities here. For instance, Paul mentioned that he doesn't like losing his mouse pointer when using multiple screens. He prefers how, when he uses 2 laptops, he has 2 separate mouse pointers. One way to solve this problem would be to allow for the option of having separate mouse pointers on separate screens, and the active mouse pointer would be determined by a keystroke of some sort. But taking a step back, designers should never fail to consider killing the middle man--or mouse rather. Virtual reality systems detect user intention through head and eye movements. Similarly, we can determine the active screen by detecting which way the user is facing or looking. (Thanks, Paul, for the idea.) But then further problems arise. What if the user is looking at a screen but operating on another one? What if there are multiple users in front of the screens? This problem gets more interesting by the second.</p>

        <p>On a different note, what if we slap some touch-sensing on the extra screens and...TA-DA we have dual-function screen-tablets (screenblets?). Why not, it's just the reverse of what people are already doing--<a class="section" target="_blank" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Tablet-Second-Monitor/">using tablets as second screens</a>.</p>
