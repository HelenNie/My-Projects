        <p>Hi! This site details the Honey Badger's storyboard for a gag room in the "Mystery Manor", as well as three concept sketches from each member that relate to the gag ideas </a>.</p>
        <h4>Storyboard Description</h4>
        <p>The first gag involves floorboards that are precariously sticking up from the floor. Upon inspection the group learns that the floorboards can be pushed back into the floor, which prompts the team to push as many back in as they possibly can. Eventually enough panels are pushed in (depending on group size), and the unit proceeds in their adventure</a>.</p> 
        <p>The second step in the adventure begins when the group is faced with a room filled with gramophones, old records, and a bookshelf. A voice (played from a central record player or overhead) instructs the group to mix and match records based on one of their labels (color, shape, etc.). Correctly matched records will begin to spin and play instructions through the speaker</a>.</p> 
        <p>The group will be instructed to pull out certain books from the bookshelf based on clues. Eventually the bookcase will be released with a *click* and will give way to something behind it. All the while, a hidden camera will take pictures for use later in the adventure </a>.</p>

        <h4>Bent Plank</h4>
        <p>An electromaget is connected to the end of a tipped plank that sticks out from the ground.  Current will be running during the game making the magnets want to connect to another, but the spring will keep the plank tipped.  After a user steps on the tipped end of the plank, the two electromagnets will touch, and their bond will be stronger than the spring force, allowing for the plank to stay flat on the ground.  To reset, the current will be cut off from the circuit, so only the spring force remains and lifts the plank back to the bent position.</p>
        <h4>Gramophone</h4>
        <p>Correctly mixing and matching records to gramophones plays music and instructions to a certain task when the handle is cranked.  Incorrect matchings result in silence when the handle is cranked.  Each gramophone will have sets of shapes along its side, and each record will have one set of shapes.  Users will have to decide which set of shapes on the gramophone is the one to be matched with the record.  A reader on the inside of the gramophone will reset each round to call a match the other set of shapes on the gramophone.</p>
        <h4>Book</h4>
        <p>After the user correctly matches a record to a gramophone, the gramphone will give instructions to pull a book half-way out of the bookcase.  This is an x-ray view of the rail/hole that will go underneath the book for easy sliding.  A stationary stopper attached to the edge of the bookcase will stop the book from being completely pulled out.  Two sensors on separate sides of the rail/hole will determine when the book is pulled out or pushed in.</p>

        <h4>Bookshelf</h4>
        <p>This bookshelf will be covered with famous books. Most of them will be bolted into the shelf so they can never be removed. The few books that move are the ones the gramophone instructs the people to pull out. Each book is on a track that has a mechanical stop, keeping the books from being completely removed. There are hidden cameras along each shelf that have face recognition software to take secret pictures of the guests.</p>

        <br> 

        <h4>Book</h4>
        <p>All of the books will be famous titles such as Gone with the Wind. Another option for the hidden cameras is to have them on each book. This would make it closer to the person’s face, but could cause other issues. The cameras would be harder to hide in the books, and people may accidentally cover them with their hands when they push the books in.

        <br>

        <h4>Gramophone</h4>
        <p>This gramophone is modeled after a real one, but it is modernized on the inside. The record and gramophone match up with RFID. The needle on it is just for show to avoid any injuries or breakage. The records and gramophones all have shapes on them that are different colors and patterns. The users have to figure out whether to match the shapes or the colors/patterns. Once they think the record is on the right gramophone they crank the handle and listen to the speaker telling them to pull out a book. </p>

        <h4>Creaky Floorboard</h4>
        <p>As detailed by the storyboard, our first room has boards that stick out of the floor which need to be depressed in order for the group to advance. My design is very simple. Boards are hinged at one end, and held out of the floor by a torsional spring. As someone steps on it, they depress the board back into the floor, and also trigger an endstop sensor. Once an adequate number of endstop sensor have been triggered (determined by group size), the next door will open. A creaking sound could be created by experimenting with wood-metal rubbing as the board is moved.</p>
        <br>
        <br> 
        <br>  

        <h4>Complex Locked Door</h4>
        <p>Many groups have either hidden or locked doors, and I wanted to explore what this may look like. I envisioned a bunch of complex mechanisms all working in parellel in order to open a lock, similar to what would be found inside a watch. I think this would take a normally mundane event, like a door opening, and transform it into something with visual "wow factor". Within this door are worm gears, bar linkages, pistons, planetary gears, geneva mechanisms, etc, and I think any casual observer would be fascinated watching it.

        <h4>Gramophone</h4>
        <p>The gramophone is visually similar to one in real life, but it is retrofitted for the purposes of this room. It has a speaker and RFID reader on the inside. The RFID reader can determine which record the group has placed upon the gramophone, and make an auditory response accordingly using the speaker. </p>

        <li><p>Embedded Record</p></li>
        <p>A plastic mold that resembles a record is embedded with a serial number and bar code. Each record has a unique ID that is assigned to an RFID scanner contained in the record player. Users will have to match the record to one of the record players, either by matching the shape, color, or number that can be seen on the record.</p>

        <br> 
        <br> 
        <br> 

        <li><p>Record Player</p></li>
        <p>Each record player will contain an RFID scanner, a small electric motor, and a speaker. Once the correct record is identified by the RFID, the motor will spin the record, which will fit to the star-shaped pin, and the speaker will play, providing instructions to the users. </p>

        <br>

        <li><p>Bookshelf</p></li>
        <p>Instructions provided by the record player will correspond to a bookshelf, which will have a number of books tilted off of the shelf by small actuators. Users will be instructed to push certain books back into the shelf in a certain order, or be forced to repeat all instructions. Once the group leaves, the books will be easily reset by the actuators. </p>

         <li><p>Sliding bookcase</p></li>
         <p>There is a trigger that once all the books are pushed in, the bookcase slides to the left to reveal what was hidden behind it</a>.</p>
          <li><p>Hidden camera within bookcase</p></li>
          <p>There is a hidden camera within the books that takes a surprise picture of the group once everyone crowds around it. The picture taken will show up in a later adventure</a>.</p>
          <li><p>Gramophone Matching</p></li>
          <p>The users have to mix and match the disks to the correct gramophone. The hint they are giving are the symbols on the disk and gramophone. They have to match them like the game "set", where they have to match the symbols a certain way. They have to match by one criteria. Either by number, shading, or shape. A set, for example, could be the same number, but different shading and shape. When there is a match, the gramphone plays a clue with a musical tune. this is reset by making the users match a different set across al gramophones. </a>.</p>
